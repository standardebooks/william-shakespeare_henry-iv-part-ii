A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood; which, before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme: it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land, manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</td>

									<span>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</span>

									<span>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</span>

									<span>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</span>
									<br/>

									<span>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</span>

									<span>Yet, though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</span>

									<span>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By whose fell working I was first advanced</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</span>

									<br/>
